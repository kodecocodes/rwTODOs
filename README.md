# rwTODOs

add a new xxxx

this time i creat lines and delete some of the words that used to exist

last time i failed to make git merge it in a normal way

this time i first make a commit on another branch (REWDME.md_imrpovement) then switch back to the master and make this edition

i guess git will find the different editions in the branches of master and REWDME.md_improvement

This repo is a collection of TODO lists and ideas for raywenderlich.com
